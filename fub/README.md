## What does it do?

This block can fetch data from any API endpoint.

APIs can be saved to globalConfig so that you can re-run them whenever you want

Data is appended to your table and not overwritten

## What about CORS?

CORS support via proxy server is coming soon. For now, make sure to send the correct headers in your API response.
